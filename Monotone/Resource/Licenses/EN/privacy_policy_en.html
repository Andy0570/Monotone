                    <p>
                      We may disclose your personal information to law
                      enforcement and governmental entities when required by
                      law or in the good-faith belief that such action is
                      necessary to comply with applicable laws, in response
                      to a facially valid court order, judicial or other
                      government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise
                      cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental
                      agencies. We may also disclose your personal
                      information to a third party in the event of any
                      potential or completed reorganization, merger, sale,
                      joint venture, assignment, transfer or other
                      disposition of all or any portion of our business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We rely on third party services providers to perform a
                      variety of services on our behalf, such as identity
                      verification, detection of fraud or security threats,
                      telephone or technical support, payment card
                      processing, hosting services, and data storage or
                      processing, and we may transfer your personal
                      information to our service providers for such
                      purposes. Third party service providers have access to
                      and may collect personal information only as needed to
                      perform their functions and are not permitted to share
                      or use the information for any other purpose.

                    <p>
                      When we disclose your personal information to third
                      parties, we take reasonable measures to ensure that
                      the rules set forth in this Privacy Policy are
                      complied with and that such third parties provide
                      sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate
                      technical and organisational measures to protect your
                      personal information.

                    <p>
                      We take your privacy very seriously and have
                      implemented physical, organizational and technological
                      security measures with a view to protecting your
                      personal information from loss or theft, unauthorized
                      access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. In
                      particular, we encrypt the Unsplash website with SSL;
                      we periodically review information collection,
                      storage, and processing practices; and we restrict
                      access to your information on a need-to-know basis for
                      our employees, contractors, and agents who are subject
                      to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and
                      may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet
                      these obligations.

                    <p>
                      Despite the measure outlined above, no method of
                      information transmission or information storage is
                      100% secure or error-free, so we unfortunately cannot
                      guarantee absolute security. If you have reason to
                      believe that your interaction with us is no longer
                      secure (for example, if you feel that the security of
                      any information that you provided to us has been
                      compromised), please contact us immediately using the

                        if we are, request access to your personal
                        information. This enables you to receive a copy of

                        erasure, for example, where the personal information

                        its accuracy or the reason for processing it;
